ENGINE
------

make a batch file that builds the content file manually
Add transform, gameobject, behaviour, etc. into Lua so that the Lua files can interact with the world. Basically each environment table will have these values filled in.
	transform (get/set position, rotation, etc.)
	InputManager

Good goal is to have the spinning camera be done fully through Lua.

InputManager that handles checking for player input without caring about SDL events. Should be useable in Lua so a camera controller script can be made.

Camera controller using inputmanager, like unity controls

OPTIONAL
--------

AudioManager that handles playing audio. ContentManager should have new audio functionality.

Logger service that handles logging to different places with prefixes like [Lua] and [Render].

GameObjectManager that handles creating and destroying GameObjects
BehaviourManager that handles creating and destroying Behaviours
Scene loading from file

Make transform's child/parent stuff work safely rather than just hoping a transform doesn't exist in multiple objects
Get/Set functions for all transform's properties
